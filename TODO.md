# TODO

## Main Logic

1. Run benchmark against competing methods (Palomar's BSUM-MM, Potaptchik's IPM, MOSEK, CVXPY)
    - Can start with simulated data, then do it on real data later
2. Build a mini-class to solve mean-variance portfolio with piecewise linear transaction costs
    - Can start with the simplest quadratic utility maximization, and try out max-return, min-variance, max-ratio formulations
    - Then try out other optimization problems such as CVaR, CDaR
3. Add factor analysis into the equation for potential speed-ups
4. Add holding cost

## Good development
1. Add CI-CD jazz
2. Github workflow
3. Create documentation page
